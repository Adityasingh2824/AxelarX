cp env.example .env.local

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up local Linera network
./scripts/deploy-local.sh
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash

# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Rust (Smart Contracts)
- Follow the official [Rust Style Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/)
- Use `cargo fmt` for formatting
- Use `cargo clippy` for linting
- Document all public functions and modules

```rust
/// Calculates the total value of an order
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// * `price` - The price per unit
/// * `quantity` - The number of units
/// 
/// # Returns
/// The total value as a fixed-point number
pub fn calculate_total(price: Price, quantity: Quantity) -> Amount {
    // Implementation
}
```

#### TypeScript/JavaScript (Frontend)
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use functional components with hooks
- Document complex functions with JSDoc

```typescript
/**
 * Custom hook for managing market data
 * @param symbol - Trading pair symbol (e.g., "BTC/USDT")
 * @returns Market data and loading state
 */
export function useMarketData(symbol: string): MarketDataResult {
  // Implementation
}
```

#### CSS/Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Create reusable component classes in globals.css
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use semantic color names from the design system
